# Apartment Business Management System

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Apartment rent business is very common now a days. But it’s very hard for a company to store and calculate all the business data manually if they have a lot of apartments. Now we will make an Apartment Business Management which will help them a lot to keep all the data up to date and check all the calculation with in a very short time.

<h2>Objective</h2>
Our main goal is to make the apartment business management very easy to its owner. We also help those people who are struggling to find apartment according to their location and budget.
To achieve our goal we will give some perfect features for Businessman and Customer. The features are
  
  1.	Multiple User System:There will be two types of user. Admin panel and general user. Admin panel can access all types of data including general users profile and able to modify them. General user can access limited data from the main database.

  2.	Business Management: Suppose, a company has total 10 Buildings and some other properties under construction. Each Building has 30-35 flats. The owner can create new table for each building. There will be a field for entering the initial cost of that building construction. Then he can store all the data of the flats. At the end of each month, he can check how much money he has earned from that building. He can also check that the amount of money he has earned from that building so far is higher than the initial cost of the building construction or not. This feature will show him about the profit or loss about that building.

  3. Flat Rent System: Suppose a user has to rent a flat. But he has a tight budget. So he can search flats from the database with price, area and number of rooms. After renting a flat his information will be stored in the specific flat table. He can’t access all data from the main database. He can see which flats are for rent, how many rooms are in the flats, where is that building situated, what is the rent fee of that flat etc.
